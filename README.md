**Official golang implementation of the Bytom SPV Wallet.**

Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch. Binary archives are published at https://github.com/bytom-spv/bytom-spv/releases.

## What is Bytom SPV Wallet?

Bytom is software designed to operate and connect to highly scalable blockchain networks confirming to the Bytom Blockchain Protocol, which allows partipicants to define, issue and transfer digitial assets on a multi-asset shared ledger. Please refer to the [White Paper](https://github.com/bytom-spv/wiki/blob/master/White-Paper/%E6%AF%94%E5%8E%9F%E9%93%BE%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E4%B9%A6-%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E7%89%88.md) for more details.

In the current state `bytom spv wallet` is able to:

- Manage key, account as well as asset
- Send transactions, i.e., issue, spend and retire asset


## Building from source

### Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.8 or higher, with `$GOPATH` set to your preferred directory

### Installation

Ensure Go with the supported version is installed properly:

```bash
$ go version
$ go env GOROOT GOPATH
```

- Get the source code

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bytom-spv/bytom-spv.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/bytom-spv
```

- Build source code

``` bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/bytom
$ make bytomd    # build bytomd
```

When successfully building the project, the `bytomd`  should be present in `cmd/bytomd` directory.

## Running bytom spv wallet

Currently, bytom is still in active development and a ton of work needs to be done, but we also provide the following content for these eager to do something with `bytom`. This section won't cover all the commands of `bytomd` at length, for more information, please the help of every command, e.g.

### Initialize

First of all, initialize the node:

```bash
$ cd ./cmd/bytomd
$ ./bytomd init --chain_id mainnet
```

There are three options for the flag `--chain_id`:

- `mainnet`: connect to the mainnet.
- `testnet`: connect to the testnet wisdom.
- `solonet`: standalone mode.

After that, you'll see `config.toml` generated, then launch the node.

### launch

``` bash
$ ./bytomd node
```

available flags for `bytomd node`:

```
      --auth.disable                Disable rpc access authenticate
      --chain_id string             Select network type
  -h, --help                        help for node
      --mining                      Enable mining
      --p2p.dial_timeout int        Set dial timeout (default 3)
      --p2p.handshake_timeout int   Set handshake timeout (default 30)
      --p2p.laddr string            Node listen address.
      --p2p.max_num_peers int       Set max num peers (default 50)
      --p2p.pex                     Enable Peer-Exchange  (default true)
      --p2p.seeds string            Comma delimited host:port seed nodes
      --p2p.skip_upnp               Skip UPNP configuration
      --prof_laddr string           Use http to profile bytomd programs
      --vault_mode                  Run in the offline enviroment
      --wallet.disable              Disable wallet
      --wallet.rescan               Rescan wallet
      --web.closed                  Lanch web browser or not
```

Given the `bytomd` node is running, the general workflow is as follows:

- create key, then you can create account and asset.
- send transaction, i.e., build, sign and submit transaction.
- query all kinds of information, let's say, avaliable key, account, key, balances, transactions, etc.

__simd feature:__

You could enable the _simd_ feature to speed up the _PoW_ verification (e.g., during mining and block verification) by simply:
```
bytomd node --simd.enable
```

To enable this feature you will need to compile from the source code by yourself, and `make bytomd-simd`. 

What is more,

+ if you are using _Mac_, please make sure _llvm_ is installed by `brew install llvm`.
+ if you are using _Windows_, please make sure _mingw-w64_ is installed and set up the _PATH_ environment variable accordingly.

For more details about using `bytomcli` command please refer to [API Reference](https://github.com/bytom-spv/bytom/wiki/API-Reference)

### Dashboard
